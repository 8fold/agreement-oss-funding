# OSS Sponsor Agreement by 8fold

**8fold OSS Agreement with Sponsors** 

8fold Practitioners create software applications and open source projects to help others progress in the work that is meaningful to them.

**Primary principle:** If you create or acquire it, you help maintain it. (Welcome to Earth.)

**Secondary principle:** If you’re no good to yourself, you’ll be no good to others.

These principles inform how we support the open source community and creators. 

How we redistribute financial contributions:

1. 85% goes to the infrastructure and 8fold Practitioners maintaining, supporting, and improving an 8fold OSS project.
2. 10% is divided evenly across all first-degree non-8fold dependencies for the 8fold OSS project.
3. 5% is divided evenly across nonprofit organizations that create, support, and contribute to maintaining the web of human knowledge and effort.

A good faith effort is made determining if a project accepts financial contributions and their preferred platform. Therefore, while a project may use GitHub Sponsors, the maintainers may prefer a platform like Open Collective; 8fold would contribute through Open Collective.

- If you prefer to support the non-8fold projects and organizations directly without sponsoring 8fold, please do.
- If an 8fold project makes your life easier, and you don’t make money directly or indirectly from its use, consider giving a star and telling others about the project.
- If an 8fold project does the above, and you make money directly or indirectly from its use, please consider sponsoring the project. Our preferred platform is Open Collective, and direct links are available on each project; if GitHub Sponsors is easier for you, that’s fine.

Our goal is to increase the self-sustainability of 8fold to increase the percentage given to first-degree dependencies and the nonprofit organizations we support.

Organizations we support:

1. World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
2. The Internet Archive
3. The Wikimedia Foundation 
4. The PHP Foundation 

Note: The more projects and organizations 8fold supports, the less each will be able to receive from us. This is deliberate to the design as it inspires us to focus on creating software with minimal dependencies (often libraries instead of frameworks) and to aid organizations that shape the infrastructure and standards associated with the web of human knowledge and effort. Further, we will favor root projects, not wrappers or extensions of other projects; in other words, projects with fewer dependencies.
